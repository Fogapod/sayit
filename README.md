# Say It!

Allows defining a set of patterns to be replaced in string. This is a glorified regex replace, a sequence of them. Primary use case is for simulating silly speech accents.

Originally based on python [pink-accents](https://git.based.computer/fogapod/pink-accents) and primarily developed for [ssnt](https://github.com/SS-NT/ssnt/tree/main) game.

Currently unusable on it's own because you cannot construct `Accent` using internal structures but there is a plan to support programmatic definitions.

## Types of replacements

Accent is a sequence of rules which are applied in order.
Each rule consists of regex pattern and a replacement. When regex match occurs the replacement is called. It then decides what to put instead (if anything).

Default replacements:

- `Original: ()`: Do not replace
- `Literal :"text"`: Puts string as is. Has templating and case mimicking by default
- `Any: [inner, ...]`: Selects random replacement with equal weights
- `Weights: [(weight, inner), ...]`: Selects replacement based on relative weights
- `Upper: inner`: Converts inner result to uppercase
- `Lower: inner`: Converts inner result to lowercase
- `Template: inner`: Enables regex templating for inner type
- `NoTemplate: inner`: Disables regex templating for inner type
- `MimicCase: inner`: Enables case mimicking for inner type
- `NoMimicCase: inner`: Disables case mimicking for inner type
- `Concat: (left, right)`: Adds `left` and `right` together

## Replacement trait

Simplest custom replacement that always returns `"foo"`:

```rs
// deserialization is only required with `deserialize` crate feature
#[derive(Clone, Debug, serde::Deserialize)]
pub struct Foo;

// `typetag` dependency is required to deserialize trait object
#[typetag::deserialize]
impl sayit::replacement::Replacement for Foo {
    fn generate<'a>(
        &self,
        // regex match
        caps: &regex::Captures,
        // full input. this is only needed because of the broken regex
        // replace_all lifetimes
        input: &'a str,
        // current options. they are applied afterwards
        options: sayit::replacement::ReplacementOptions,
    ) -> Cow<'a, str> {
        "foo".into()
    }
}
```

## Serialized format

`deserialize` feature provides an opinionated way of defining rules, specifically designed for speech accents.
Deserialization is primarily developed to support [ron](https://github.com/ron-rs/ron) format which has it's quirks but should work in json and maybe others.

        // this is the simplest rule to replace all "windows" words (separated by regex \b)
        // occurences with "linux", case sensitive
        ("windows", {"Literal": "linux"}),
        // this replaces word "OS" with one of replacements, with equal probability
